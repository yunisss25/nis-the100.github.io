                Lincoln is a Grounder who has loyalty to the Sky People.  Although he and The 100 didn’t start on the right foot, they became strong allies.  Lincoln went against the brutal customs of his people,  so that he and Octavia can be together.  Plus, what the Grounders were doing to the newcomers was wrong.  Lincoln believes that there can be peace between the two groups, and tries very hard to establish it.  Like several other characters, Lincoln too suffered from mental duress but got cleaned and sober.
