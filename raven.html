                Raven is sassy, a bad-ass, and overall, is ‘one of the guys.’  She is gifted in mechanics, along with data processing and technology, and used her talents to construct working radios, and a voice over the system to contact the ARK.  In addition, she had rebuilt a pod and made a bomb out of a simple tin can.   She can throw a punch when she feels like it is deserved, and has a short fuse.  She faces her hurt by temporary physical comfort, resulting in a negative backlash.  However, Raven is willing to sacrifice herself, for the sake of others.  Although she is disabled, she does not let it come in the way of her ambitions.  Raven is a strong representation for the challenged and those with chronic pain.
