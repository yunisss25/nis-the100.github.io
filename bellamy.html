                Bellamy Blake is not one of The 100 but sneaked on the dropship so he can watch and protect his younger sister, Octavia.  He is also the oldest.  He is strong, sometimes ignorant, but he always does the right thing.  After a few misdirections, he has changed his perspectives on life.  Bellamy will do anything to protect his people, especially Clarke.  Yet, he also saved others outside the Sky People, and will become fractured if he failed at his goals.  Bellamy is a very proud man, and will not let anyone else fight his battles.  Bellamy holds a strong bond with Kane, who is like an unintentional father figure to him.  He is, along with Clarke, the leader of the Sky People.
